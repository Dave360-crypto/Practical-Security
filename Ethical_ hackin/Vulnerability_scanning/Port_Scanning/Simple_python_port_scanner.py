#Simple port scanner with python
#This code was written by Malvern Shaurwa
#first we import a socket library which is needed for us to connect to ip address
import socket

#now creating an object for socket class
#socket.AF_NET stands for the ipv4
#socket.SOCK_STREAM stands for were are going to use tcp packets inorder to perform
#the connections

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

#We create two variables for port and host

port = int(input("Enter your port number you want to scan: "))
host = input("Enter the ip address you want to scan: ")

#now we create a function to test the connection

def portscanner(port):
    if sock.connect_ex((host,port)):
        print("Port %d is closed"%port )
    else:
          print("Port  %d is open" %port)

portscanner(port)
